Data Section:
We have selected a data set that represents the change in GDP of the US economy and an additional set of the performances of NFL football teams.

The GDP data set - The GDP data set includes the quarterly reports of GDP in billions of current dollars, GDP in billions of chained 2009 dollars, the percentage change of GDP dollars, and GDP percent change based on chained 2009 dollars. The limitation of this data set is it only records GDP until 2018. The context is it measures the growth of GDP in the US from 1947 to 2018 giving quarterly updates.  

The performances of NFL football teams â€“ This set includes statistics about the regular season performance of each NFL team from 1999 to 2022. Variables include but are not limited to, points scored, points allowed, wins, losses, ties, score differential, offense/defense completion percentage, offense/defense total yards gained pass/run, and offense/defense average yards gained pass/run. The limitations of the data set are that it only provides about 23 years of data, and we can only use it up to 2018 because of the limitations with our other data set. The context of this data set is it provides all the statistical information from every team in the NFL from the last 23 years.

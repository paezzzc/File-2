For question one we used points scored on average in the entire league for the 19 years of stats provided in the NFL data 
and matched them with the GDP to find a simple positive relationship between an increase in GDP and an increase in the points 
scored on average per year in the NFL. Once this relationship was established it allowed us to explore the more complicated 
questions pertaining to particular teams or certain events such as financial crises.

For question two we used Tableau to create a multi-axis chart, allowing us to observe multiple variables. For the Y-axis, 
the variable record percentage (wins/losses) and year of observations. For the X-axis, we used GDP to measure the change in
record percentage on average for the league to see if there were any years where financial crises may have impacted team 
performance.

For question three, we ran a regression in R to measure the performance of all 32 teams using dummy variables.
We ran regressions with points scored, offense competition percentage, and offense total years gained pass until a significant
relationship between GDP and total offensive yards gained was established.
